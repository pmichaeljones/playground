      It's been a while since I wrote a blog post, so I thought I should probably tell you all what's happening.
    %p
      A few years back, like 2011, I started a company called "Text Marketing Miami" while living in, wait for it, Miami.
    %p
      Horrible name for a company. Makes me cringe just thinking about it. First tip for you aspiring internet entrepreneurs out there; unless you never plan on expanding your business into new markets,
      %span{:style => "font-weight: bold;"}
        don't use a city name in your business name!
    %p
      As soon as you tie yourself to a geographic region you ostracize potential clients in different cities. Text Marketing Miami was a text message marketing company that, technically, could work in any city. I received numerous calls from people asking, "Does your service work in Boca Raton?", "Does your service work in Tampa?". Of course it did! However, with a name like Text Marketing Miami, they were unsure. Just think how many people never called me and just assumed that my service wouldn't work in their area.
    %p
      Anyways, I digress.
    %p
      I knew I wanted to start a business that allowed me to travel, as much as possible. If there's one thing that makes me happy, it's getting into an airplane and going somewhere that I've never been before. Most of my friends after college got jobs at big Fortune 500 companies. I went to a good business school, and that's what expected of you when you leave a business school. They bragged about their 2 weeks of paid vacation a year and their $50,000 salaries. 2 weeks?!?!? That's not even enough time to settle into a new city. I like to spend at least a month in each destination I visit. You get to know the people, the food, the little neighborhood you call home, etc. I knew the corporate world of 10 days of paid vacation was not going to work.
    %p
      After realizing that gyms were going to be my target market, I changed the name go GymTexter. I just looked for the old logo online but I can't find it anywhere. It was a dumbbell with GYM on top and TEXTER below. It was a good start. However, once again, I ostracized some potential businesses. Why would a yoga studio use a service with the word "gym" in the name? Fail #2. Well, third time was a charm and

      was born.

      People Will Call You Lucky. Just Laugh to Yourself
    %p
      If there's one thing that "unhappy with their place in life" people like to do, it's take credit away from hard-working individuals and give that credit to that sultry mistress they call LUCK. Follwing this thought process, it's not their own fault that they're unhappy with life, it's just that this other person happens to be really LUCKY. See what I'm saying? I can't tell you how many times I've heard,
      %span{:style => "font-weight: bold;"}
        "Man Patrick, you're so lucky you get to travel so much."
      Oh really, so it's just luck that got me here? What about the thousands of hours I've put into building this business? What about the hours of phone calls I've made talking with gyms owners? That's all luck you say? No, it's hard work. Luck is winning the lottery and being wealthy for the rest of your life. The only luck I've been dealt was being raised in a middle-class family by great parents who encouraged my sisters and me to pursue our dreams. The rest of this has been hard work.
    %p
      However, like the headline of this paragraph says, just laugh to yourself. There's no use vocalizing your anger with these people. They're probably just unhappy with their current situation and instead of addressing it head on, they take solace in believing that their position in life is luck-based, instead of self-determined. Whenever someone brings up luck, I usually reply,
      %span{:style => "font-weight: bold;"}
        "Yeah, I'm really fortunate to be able to travel as much as I do."
      and leave it at that.
