      It's been a while since I wrote a blog post, so I thought I should probably tell you all what's happening.

      A few years back, I started a company called "Text Marketing Miami" while living in, wait for it, Miami.

      Horrible name for a company. Makes me cringe just thinking about it. First tip for you aspiring internet entrepreneurs out there; don't use a city name in your business name! As soon as you tie yourself to a geographic region you ostracize potential clients in different cities. Text Marketing Miami was a text message marketing company that, technically, could work in any city. I received numerous calls from people asking, "Does your service work in Boca Raton?", "Does your service work in Tampa?". Of course it did! However, with a name like Text Marketing Miami, they were unsure. Just think how many people never called me and just assumed that my service wouldn't work in their area.

      Anyways, I digress.
