Welcome to my personal Ruby on Rails playground, where I implement my ideas.

Check back often!

I'm Patrick Jones, a former SEO/SEM associate that was sick of having great ideas I couldn't build, so I decided to learn to code.

My personal website is http://PatrickJones.me and the blog is http://PatrickJones.me/blog

I blog about most of the projects I put on this site.

This project, hosted on Heroku, is where I implement ideas that come to me; be it in the shower or while brushing my teeth.

I'm especially interested in API work. I think API mashups are SUPER COOL, and I hope to have a few on this site.

If you need to contact me, please do so at pmichaeljones@gmail.com

I'm available for contract work and I LOVE to travel, so a 1-3 month project in a new city is right up my alley.

All I require is a hotel, a per diem, lots of coffee and a reasonable contractors rate.
